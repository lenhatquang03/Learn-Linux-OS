# Learn-Linux-OS
My solutions for OS coding exercises for the Operating System class at Hanoi University of Science and Technology

## Installation
- The C programs contain POSIX headers such as <code><unistid.h></code>, <code><pthread.h></code>, etc. It is recommended that **the latest Oracle's Virtual Box together with Ubuntu versions** are downloaded to your local machine. You can refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hva8lsV2nTk">this video</a>. for the download
- Afterwards, make sure to **share the code folders on your local machine to the virtual machine**!
